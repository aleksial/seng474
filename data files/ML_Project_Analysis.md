# Bus Ridership Prediction ML Project - Data Analysis & Recommendations

## Current Data Inventory

### 1. **Transit Demand Data** (`streamlined_transit_data.csv`)
**Location**: `data files/demand/streamlined_transit_data.csv`
- **Granularity**: Census Dissemination Area (DA) level
- **Records**: ~145 rows
- **Key Features Available**:
  - `Population_Density_Demand` (1-5 scale)
  - `Commute_PT_Demand` (Public Transit demand, 1-5 scale)
  - `Bus_Stop_Proximity` (1-5 scale)
  - `Route_Coverage_Percent` (1-5 scale)
  - `Bus_Stop_Density` (1-5 scale)
  - `Income_Demand` (1-5 scale)
  - `Overall_Demand` (aggregated score)
  - `Employment_Demand` (1-5 scale)
  - `Commute_Duration_Demand` (1-5 scale)
  - Geographic coordinates (longitude, latitude)
  - Distance metrics for each demand type

**⚠️ Important Note**: This contains **demand metrics**, not actual ridership counts.

### 2. **Bus Network Data**
**Locations**: 
- `data files/roads/bus_network_nodes.csv` - Bus stop locations (1,932 nodes)
- `data files/roads/bus_network_edges.csv` - Bus route segments (1,878 edges)

**Features**:
- Node coordinates (projected coordinate system)
- Edge connectivity and lengths
- Road characteristics (highway type, lanes, etc.)

### 3. **Population Data** (`victoria_census_da.csv`)
- Census data at DA level
- Population counts
- Household data
- Geographic boundaries

### 4. **Points of Interest (POI)**
- **Healthcare Facilities** (`healthcare_facilities.csv`): ~67 facilities with lat/lon
- **Schools** (`schools.csv`): ~1,000+ schools (BC-wide, need filtering for Victoria)

### 5. **Geographic Boundaries**
- City limits
- Zoning data
- Census DA boundaries

## Critical Questions for Project Scope

### Question 1: Target Variable
**What exactly do you want to predict?**
- **Option A**: Actual ridership counts (number of people boarding at each stop)
  - **Challenge**: We don't have actual ridership data in the current dataset
  - **Solution**: Would need to obtain ridership data from transit authority
  
- **Option B**: Demand scores (using existing `Overall_Demand` or similar metrics)
  - **Advantage**: Data already available
  - **Use case**: Identify high-demand areas for new stops
  
- **Option C**: Predict demand at bus stop level (aggregate DA-level data to stops)
  - **Approach**: Map DA demand metrics to nearest bus stops

**Recommendation**: Start with Option C to build the model, then refine when actual ridership data is available.

### Question 2: Prediction Granularity
**At what level do you want predictions?**
- Individual bus stops (1,932 stops)
- Census DA areas (145 areas)
- Route segments
- Time-based (hourly/daily/weekly patterns)

### Question 3: Temporal Dimension
**Do you need time-based predictions?**
- Current data appears to be static (snapshot in time)
- For realistic predictions, you'd need:
  - Hour of day
  - Day of week
  - Season/weather
  - Special events

### Question 4: Feature Engineering Priorities
**Which factors are most important to you?**
1. **Spatial Features**:
   - Distance to nearest healthcare facilities
   - Distance to nearest schools
   - Population density in surrounding area
   - Bus stop density (competition/accessibility)

2. **Network Features**:
   - Number of routes serving the stop
   - Connectivity to other stops
   - Route frequency (if available)

3. **Demographic Features**:
   - Income levels
   - Employment density
   - Commute patterns

4. **Infrastructure Features**:
   - Road type/quality
   - Sidewalk availability
   - Zoning (residential vs commercial)

## Recommended Data Preparation Strategy

### Phase 1: Data Integration (High Priority)
1. **Map DA-level demand to bus stops**:
   - For each bus stop, find nearest DA(s)
   - Assign demand metrics to stops
   - Use distance-weighted averaging if stop is between multiple DAs

2. **Calculate POI proximity**:
   - Distance from each stop to nearest:
     - Healthcare facility
     - School
     - Employment center (if available)

3. **Network features**:
   - Count routes per stop
   - Calculate stop connectivity metrics

### Phase 2: Feature Engineering
1. **Spatial features**:
   - Population within 500m, 1km, 2km radius
   - POI counts within buffers
   - Distance to city center

2. **Derived features**:
   - Bus stop density (stops per km²)
   - Route diversity (number of unique routes)
   - Accessibility score (combination of multiple factors)

### Phase 3: Model Development
1. **Baseline models**:
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)

2. **Advanced models** (if spatial data allows):
   - Spatial regression models
   - Graph Neural Networks (for network structure)

## Data Quality Assessment

### Strengths
- Good spatial coverage (Victoria area)
- Multiple data sources (demand, network, POI, demographics)
- Geographic coordinates available for integration

### Limitations
- No actual ridership counts (only demand proxies)
- No temporal data (time of day, day of week)
- Bus stop coordinates in different projection system
- Schools data is BC-wide (needs filtering)

### Data Gaps to Address
1. **Actual ridership data** (if available from transit authority)
2. **Temporal patterns** (hourly/daily ridership)
3. **Route schedules** (frequency, peak times)
4. **Weather data** (if temporal predictions needed)

## Next Steps

1. **Answer the clarifying questions above**
2. **Data integration script** - Combine all data sources
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Visualize relationships
4. **Feature engineering** - Create predictive features
5. **Model development** - Build and evaluate ML models
6. **Validation** - Test predictions on held-out data
